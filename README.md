## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-neural-algebra-tutor.git
cd graph-neural-algebra-tutor

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Web Interface

Launch the interactive web application:

```bash
streamlit run web/app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

### Command Line Interface

Solve problems from the command line:

```bash
# Solve a single problem
python -m src.solver.cli "2*x + 5 = 9"

# Interactive mode
python -m src.solver.cli -i
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Solving Linear Equations

```python
from src.solver import GNNAlgebraSolver

solver = GNNAlgebraSolver()
steps = solver.solve("2*x + 5 = 9")

for i, step in enumerate(steps):
    print(f"Step {i}: {step.expression}")
    print(f"  Action: {step.description}")
```

Output:
```
Step 0: 2*x + 5 = 9
  Action: Original problem
Step 1: 2*x = 4
  Action: Subtract 5 from both sides
Step 2: x = 2
  Action: Divide both sides by 2
```

### Interactive Tutoring

```python
from src.solver import GNNAlgebraSolver, InteractiveSolver

solver = GNNAlgebraSolver()
tutor = InteractiveSolver(solver)

# Get a hint
hint = tutor.get_hint("3*x - 4 = 5")
print(hint)  # "Try adding 4 to both sides of the equation."

# Check student work
valid, feedback = tutor.check_step("3*x - 4 = 5", "3*x = 9")
print(feedback)  # "Good! That's a valid step."
```

## 📚 Research Background

This project implements ideas from several research areas:

1. **Graph Neural Networks for Mathematical Reasoning**
   - Representing expressions as graphs preserves structural information
   - GNNs can learn mathematical transformations

2. **Step-by-Step Solution Generation**
   - Iterative generation produces more reliable results than end-to-end approaches
   - Similar to approaches in automated theorem proving

3. **Symbolic-Neural Integration**
   - Combines neural flexibility with symbolic correctness guarantees
   - Ensures all generated steps are mathematically valid
